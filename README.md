# Brick-Breaker-OpenGL

This is an OpenGL mini 2D game, simulating the wide-known brick breaker. Having a bunch of bricks ahead you, the mission is to break them all, with one of the white balls. There are also periodical powerups which make the game more interesting. Each one slightly changes the in-game stats, making the game more difficult, but also more fun.

This game is playable on the OpenGL platform, and Microsoft Visual Studio has a great OpenGL library plugin.
